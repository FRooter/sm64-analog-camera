# SM64 Analog Camera

### Update
A new camera mechanism from n64decomp has made this repo's camera system obsolete. However, the three controller-related files are still relevant if you're targeting Windows, Linux and Web.

This is based off of n64decomp/sm64, for Windows/Linux and Web targets. This will obviously break camera controls on a N64.
Similar to previous ROM hacks, we re-route Player 1's right stick movement to the left stick of P2, and then feed that data into the game's camera system.

This is no longer a work-in-progress, and a video of its functioning can be found [here.](https://streamable.com/l794rj)
